SQLFlamel
=========

A simple SQLAlchemy_ bootstrapping/skeleton file. Its name pays homage to the
noted alchemist Nicholas Flamel who, along with Dumbledore, created the legendary
Sorcerer's Stone.

SQLFlamel's main purpose is to provide some additional syntactic-sugar when
working with SQLAlchemy_ directly (and not through some some other wrapper
library). It accomplishes this by enforcing a few small, unobtrusive API
constraints on the user.

Example
=======

See the example.py_ file for a heavily documentated example of usage. The main
sqlflamel.py_ source file is what you will need to include in your project.

NOTICE
======

If you have any other neat, small SQLAlchemy_ "hacks" that you use when boostrapping
your own projects, I'd be very interested to see them; if you're willing to share. :)
