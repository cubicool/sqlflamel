SQLFlamel
=========

A simple SQLAlchemy_ bootstrapping/skeleton file. Its name pays homage to the
noted alchemis Nicholas Flamel, who, along with Dumbledore, created the legendar
Sorcerer's Stone. :)

SQLFlamel's main purpose is to provide some additional syntactic-sugar when
working with SQLAlchemy_ directy (and not through some some other wrapper
library). It accomplishes this by enforcing a few small, unobtrusive API
constraints on user.

Example
=======

See the example.py_ file for a heavily documentated example of usage. You can
look at the small sqlflamel.py_ source file directly.
