# This helper function wraps the most common kind of relationship creation. It
# accepts an existing ORM type as the first argument, the column to match
# against using that type, the table name of the locally scoped ORM type (where
# it is usually safe to use __tablename__) to which the SQLAlchemy backref will
# be made, and finally the column by which the backref will be matched against.
#
# For example, if an ORM type BlogPost needs to create a relationship with a
# single instance of a different ORM type User, BlogPost could call this
# function with the User type, the attribute name corresponding to User's
# primary key, the name of the BlogPost table, and a BlogPost column to sort
# the backref by. The first returned value will be an SQLAlchemy Column type,
# and will create the relationship binding between BlogPost BACK to User. The
# second returned value will be an actual SQLAlchemy realtionship, which will
# provide a BlogPost instance with attribute-like access directly to the
# foreign User instance.

# This is likely the relationship function you will find yourself most commonly
# using. It creates a relationship between the two passed in ORM types based on
# the specified attribute (which defaults to "id").
#
# The first argument will have an attribute corresponding to the name of the
# second argument (in lower case), and another corresponding to the name plus
# and underscore and the name of the attribute. FOR EXAMPLE (since there's no
# way you could possibly follow that):
#
# class User:
#   id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
#
# class BlogPost:
#   __tablename__ = "blog_posts"
#   id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
#
# sqlflamel.create_relationship(BlogPost, User)
#
# After this function call, the BlogPost ORM type will have the attributes
# "user" and "user_id", and the User ORM type will have an attribute called
# "blog_posts". We defaulted to using the attribute "id", but could just as
# easily have used any other attribute name they both shared.
#
# This is a hugely common relationship when using SQLAlchemy, and SQLFlamel
# tries to sipmlify it.

# This is a base class (required to be derived from in each ORM object) that

# A instance of this object is create for each query issued by the client.
# More specifically, it is the result typically returned by:
#
# q = db.query(MyORMType)
#
# ...which is the point at which we inject our custom methods OR allow method
# calls to pass through in the class SQLAlchemy style.

# The Database class acts purely as a base class, and relies on having a static
# method called types() defined somewhere in the namespace resolved by
# accessing self. This list returned by this static method should contain each
# ORM object that will be exposed in session instances created by this
# Database. Those tables will be available as attributes, and a new SQLAlchemy
# query will be issued with each access.

        # FINALLY! Here is where we combine the Proxy objects above with some
        # really mastferful hackery. This block of code iterates over every ORM
        # type in the self.types() sequence and sets a property on the type
        # itself that lets you issue an SQLAlchemy query simply using
        # attribute-access syntax. Further, that attribute is itself a Proxy
        # object which, when the desired attribute or method isn't found in the
        # native query result object (i.e., filter(), filter_by(), etc.),
        # pushes the __getattr__ request up into the Proxy as a fallback.
        #
        # All of this nastiness combined lets us achieve the final syntactic
        # goal of the following:
        #
        # database = Database("sqlite://foo.sql3")
        #
        # with database.create_context() as db:
        #   db.users.all()
        #   db,users.filter_by(id=1)
        #   db.users.my_method(1, 10)
        #
        # Notice how we never have to issue db.query(User) explicitly, and also
        # note how, when db.users.my_method isn't found in the normal
        # SQLAlchemy Query results object, the lookup is then propogated
        # upwards into the Proxy object, where a matching method IS found and
        # used.
        #
        # In each case, accessing db.users actually calls a property function
        # that evaluates db.query(User) for us, and instantiates a Proxy using
        # those results.
        for obj in self.types():
            if hasattr(obj, "Proxy"):
                proxy = getattr(obj, "Proxy")
